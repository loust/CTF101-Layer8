## What is a CTF?
A CTF is a learning experience. A CTF is a challenge to yourself, seeing how far you have gone and
what you have achieved. A CTF is something to work hours and hours on to figure out something that
might not appear somewhere regularly, but the details may come across some day to make something
tick. A CTF is a flag capturing game. Some people take it as a game, some people take it as a hobby
and some people take it as life.

`Capture The Flag (CTF).`

## Writeups
After a CTF is over, competitors usually like to write about how they approached the challenges and
it is acceptable. Do so if you wish to practice your writing skills.

## How does this work?
Our CTF is built with the ctfd engine containing 52 challenges. Simply, select the challenge
you wish, read the description and start solving it! By solving it, we mean to dig in, research and
figure out how to find the flag.

### Flag formats
The official layer 8 flag format is `L8-sometext-####` for example: `L8-flaglol-1234`. Some
challenges don't follow this structure, but that will be shown in the description. Don't hesitate to
ask if the flag is correct or not! But do not abuse that power. We will tell you if it is an
alternative format or not.

## Teams or Solo?
You can choose to conduct an alliance with multiple hackers or take on the path of the lone hacker
to claim the top prize to yourself! A team is just a single user.
